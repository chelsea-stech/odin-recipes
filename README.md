# odin-recipes
This project is a place to practice all the HTML, CSS, and other skills
I have gained through my time using The Odin Project.
Skills may include: creating an index and other pages,
setting up paragraphs and lists, adding pictures, and
formatting links into the page.
Feeling super proud of the things I have accomplished 
even in just the basic website design. This is more 
than I could have done a week ago. Well on my way!
