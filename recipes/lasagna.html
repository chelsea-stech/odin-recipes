                <li>4 cups marinara sauce</li>
                <li>4 cups whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups grated parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>15 lasagna noodles, cooked according to package instructions</li>
                <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking 
                    dish lightly with nonstick spray.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef and marinara sauce.</li>
                <li>In a separate large bowl, combine the ricotta, parmesan, parsley,
                    basil, salt, pepper, and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce over the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
                    Top with 5 cooked lasagna noodles, overlapping as needed to completely
                    cover the sauce. Spread 2 cups of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.
                    Top with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat with the remaining meat
                    sauce, noodles, ricotta, and mozzarella to make 2 more layers.</li>
                <li>Bake the lasagna for 25-30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and
                    the sauce is bubbling up through the layers. Turn the broiler to high
                    and broil for 1-2 minutes, until the top layer of cheese is bubbly
                    and golden brown.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna cool for 30-45 minutes, then serve.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
